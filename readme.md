
We will apply the widely used unsupervised clustering technique called k-means algorithm to group national anthems from different countries into distinct clusters. The primary objective of k-means is to identify similarities among data points and unveil hidden patterns. The algorithm operates by searching for a predetermined number of centroids (k) within a dataset. Each centroid represents a cluster, which consists of data points that share similar characteristics according to specific criteria. The "means" in k-means pertains to the calculation of the average of data points within a cluster, which determines its centroid. Since we lack prior knowledge about the classes or groups in the dataset, the k-means algorithm is unsupervised and autonomously discovers the underlying groups.
